# Reporting a security vulnerability

To report a **security** vulnerability for Rufus (i.e. an issue that you believe could lead to malicious actors being able to exploit the Rufus application), please e-mail support@akeo.ie.

Please do **NOT** use the e-mail above if you have a regular issue, such as a problem creating or using a bootable drive. Instead go back to https://github.com/pbatard/rufus/issues and create an issue using the regular *Issue Report* template.

For any security vulnerability report, we kindly ask you to respect [responsible disclosure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsible_disclosure) practices.

In return, we will endeavour to respond to security vulnerability reports within 48 hours.
